# House Price Prediction Project Outline for Bangladesh (Using beproperty.com Dataset)

## 1. Project Overview
   - **Description:** Predicting house prices in Bangladesh using the beproperty.com dataset.
   - **Objective:** Develop an accurate and interpretable model to predict house prices based on various features.

## 2. Data Collection and Exploration
   - **2.1 Data Collection**
      - Access the beproperty.com dataset.
      - Confirm data integrity and completeness.
      - Download the dataset and save it in the project's `data/raw/` directory.

   - **2.2 Data Exploration**
      - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
      - Identify target variable (house prices) and potential predictor variables.
      - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
      - Document findings and insights in the `reports/documentation.md` file.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
   - **3.1 Cleaning**
      - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers appropriately.
      - Address any data quality issues identified during exploration.
   
   - **3.2 Feature Engineering**
      - Create new features if relevant (e.g., total area, age of property).
      - Encode categorical variables and handle numerical features as needed.

   - **3.3 Train-Test Split**
      - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
      - Reserve a portion of the data for model evaluation.

   - **3.4 Save Processed Data**
      - Save the cleaned and processed data in the `data/processed/` directory.

## 4. Model Development
   - **4.1 Model Selection**
      - Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest) based on the nature of the problem.

   - **4.2 Model Training**
      - Train the selected models on the training dataset.
      - Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

   - **4.3 Model Evaluation**
      - Evaluate models using the reserved test dataset.
      - Utilize metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared for evaluation.

   - **4.4 Feature Importance Analysis**
      - Analyze feature importance to understand the factors influencing house prices.

## 5. Model Deployment
   - **5.1 Save the Trained Model**
      - Save the trained model as a serialized file (e.g., pickle or joblib) in the `models/` directory.

   - **5.2 Deployment Options**
      - Explore deployment options, such as creating a web application or API for predictions.

## 6. Documentation and Reporting
   - **6.1 Project Summary**
      - Summarize the project, including goals, methods, and key findings.

   - **6.2 Technical Documentation**
      - Provide detailed technical documentation for code, including functions and modules.

   - **6.3 Model Performance Metrics**
      - Document model performance metrics and insights in the `reports/performance_metrics.md` file.

## 7. Communication
   - **7.1 Stakeholder Communication**
      - Prepare a non-technical summary for stakeholders.
      - Communicate results, limitations, and potential next steps.

   - **7.2 Presentation**
      - Create a presentation summarizing the project for internal or external use.

# Customer Churn Prediction in a MFS Company

## Introduction

ðŸš€ Welcome to my showcase project! In this project, I undertook the challenge of predicting customer churn in a Mobile Financial Services (MFS) company using advanced data science techniques.

### Project Overview

- **Objective:**
  - Predict customer churn to optimize retention strategies.

- **Dataset Source:**
  - Utilized a comprehensive dataset from the MFS company, including transaction details and customer information.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  - Ensured data integrity for accurate predictions.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized key trends in transaction data.
  - Identified patterns that could contribute to churn.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Transaction Features:**
  - Extracted relevant features from transaction data.
  - Engineered features like transaction frequency, average transaction amount, etc.

- **Customer Features:**
  - Incorporated customer-specific features, e.g., tenure, transaction history.

### 3. Model Selection and Training

- **Algorithm Choice:**
  - Selected machine learning models suitable for churn prediction (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

- **Model Training:**
  - Split data into training and testing sets.
  - Fine-tuned model parameters for optimal performance.

### 4. Churn Prediction

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Churn Identification:**
  - Applied the trained model to identify potential churners.

### 5. Insights and Recommendations

- **Interpretable Results:**
  - Provided insights into factors contributing to churn.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Suggested actionable strategies to reduce churn based on data findings.

## Results and Impact

### 1. Accuracy and Validation

- **Model Accuracy:**
  - Achieved high accuracy in predicting customer churn.

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - Validated results through cross-validation to ensure robustness.

### 2. Business Impact

- **Quantifiable Impact:**
  - Demonstrated how the churn prediction model can lead to tangible business benefits.

- **Optimization Strategies:**
  - Proposed strategies to retain customers and maximize customer lifetime value.

## Conclusion

ðŸŽ‰ This project showcases my expertise in predictive analytics, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. The churn prediction model equips the MFS company with actionable insights to proactively address customer retention.

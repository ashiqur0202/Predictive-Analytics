Customer Churn Prediction in a MFS Company

# Project Showcase: Customer Churn Prediction in a MFS Company

## Project Overview

### Objective:
Predict and mitigate customer churn in a Mobile Financial Services (MFS) Company using advanced data science techniques.

### Problem Statement:
Identify factors contributing to customer churn and develop a predictive model to forecast potential churners.

## Project Phases

### 1. **Data Collection and Exploration**

- Gather comprehensive data on customer transactions, interactions, and demographics.
- Explore the dataset to understand patterns, missing values, and potential features for analysis.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering: Extract relevant features for churn prediction.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Conduct in-depth EDA to uncover insights into customer behavior.
- Visualize key metrics, correlations, and trends related to churn.

### 4. **Model Development**

#### 4.1 **Feature Selection:**

- Use statistical methods and domain knowledge to select impactful features.
- Prioritize factors influencing churn based on EDA.

#### 4.2 **Model Selection:**

- Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for churn prediction (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods).
- Experiment with deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.

#### 4.3 **Model Training:**

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the selected models on the training data.

#### 4.4 **Model Evaluation:**

- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
- Fine-tune models for optimal results.

### 5. **Implementation and Integration**

- Deploy the finalized model for real-time or batch predictions.
- Integrate the churn prediction system into the MFS Company's infrastructure.

### 6. **Results and Impact Analysis**

- Present the model's performance on test data.
- Analyze the impact of the churn prediction system on customer retention.
